        Pounded yam is a smooth, stretchy Nigerian staple food made by boiling yam tubers and pounding them until they become soft, fluffy and stretchy. Pounded Yam is the most stretchy of all the Nigerian fufu recipes that is if it is well prepared. It has the softness of semolina fufu hence it is not as hard as cassava fufu. It is traditionally made with a mortar and pestle. Pounded Yam can be prepared by stirring yam flour in hot water but those who have eaten the one made from scratch with raw yams will tell you that the yam powder method does not do the pounded yam good justice. It has a slightly sweet, neutral taste that pairs perfectly with rich soups like Egusi, Ogbono or vegatable soup.

      <p>
        To prepare pounded yam from scratch, you simply cook white yam and pound the yam pieces with a mortar and pestle when done, but modern kitchens often use yam flour("instant pounded yam") or food processors for convenience.

      <h2>Instructions on making Pounded yam</h2>
      <p><em>There are many food items referred to as yam so make sure you use the white yam with dark brown skin.</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the middle part of the yam because that is where most of the starch is located(The tail does not contain enough starch and the head is too fibrous and hard to pound).</li>
        <li>Peel out the brown skin with a knife, leaving the white part of the yam.</li>
        <li>Cut the white part into smaller pieces</li>
        <li>Wash properly, put in a pot and pour enough water to cover the yam pieces.</li>
        <li>Cook until you can easily drive a knife into the yam pieces(approximately 15-20 minutes)</li>
        <li>Pound a piece of the boiled yam to ascertain desired texture.</li>
        <li>Transfer the remaining boiled yam pieces into the mortar and pound to desired texture(preserve boiled starchy water to be used later).</li>
        <li>Focus more on the bigger lumps of yam pieces until desired stretchy texture.</li>
        <li>Do same when lumps becomes smaller until desired texture</li>
        <li>Check if lumps are gone by dipping your clean finger in the mound at intervals until lumps are gone.</li>
        <li>Pound until stretchy, add a bit of water until the desire feel(use boiled water from the yam pieces as it contains starch and will give the pounded yam a better stretch)</li>
        <li>Serve accordingly with soup of choice</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Egusi Soup</h2>

        Egusi soup is a popular West African dish, especially loved in Nigeria, made with ground melon seeds(Egusi) cooked in a rich, savory broth. It is typically thickened with the seeds and flavored with palm oil, vegetables (like spinach, bitterleaf, or pumpkin leaves), assorted meats, fish and seasonings. It has a nutty flavor, a hearty texture and is usually served with staples locally called swallows like pounded yam, fufu, eba or semovita.

      <h3>Notes on the lumpy Egusi Soup Ingredients</h3>
      <p><em>This soup contains lots of onions, the amount of onions that makes the egusi soup taste more like stew rather than Nigerian soup for swallow.</em></p>
      <div>
        <h2>Before you prepare lumpy Egusi Soup</h2>
        <ol>

          <li>Grind the egusi seeds with a spice grinder.</li>
          <li>Grind the crayfish.</li>
          <li>Clean all the vegetables: peppers (deseed the sweet peppers), onions, leafy vegetables.</li>

          <li>Chop the peppers with the chopper.</li>
          <li>By now, the dry fish should be soft enough for cleaning and deboning. Clean with a brush, break into pieces and debone.</li>
          <li>Clean the stockfish with water and a brush. See the video below.</li>
          <li>Clean the beef and cow tripe.</li>

        <h2>Instructions for cooking the lumpy Egusi Soup</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Place the beef in a clean pot. Add the seasoning cube and chopped onion (half a bulb).</li>
          <li>Let it steam while stiring at all time till all the beef turns pale.</li>
          <li>Add the stockfish and cow tripe. Pour water to cover everything and start cooking.</li>
          <li>Place the ground egusi in a bowl. Add the second batch of blended onion (one bulb) and mix till everything is well combined.</li>
          <li>Make small balls of the eegusi mix and set aside. 
          <a href="#video-guide"><strong><em>Watch the video below.</em></strong></a></li>
          <li>When the meats and stockfish are done, take out the stockfish, debone and break into pieces.</li>
          <li>Separate the meat from the stock/broth and set aside.</li>
          <li>Add the red palm oil into a clean dry pot/pan.</li>
          <li>When it heats up, add the onion we chopped with a knife. Fry till transluscent.</li>
          <li>Add some of the chopped pepper and fry for about 2 minutes.</li>
          <li>Then gently add the molded egusi balls one by one such that they are not overcrowded.</li>
          <li>Cover and let it fry a bit. Then flip them to fry the underside.</li>
          <li>After some time, the egusi balls would be caked. Use you spatula to crush them to your liking. If you want very lumpy egusi soup, just crush them into two so that when you are eating, you will feel like your are chewing extra meat and fish. ðŸ˜€</li>
          <li>When happy with the size, add the crayfish, some of the stock/broth. Cover and leave it to simmer for about 10 minutes, topping up the liquid with the stock/broth from time to time.</li>
          <li>When the egusi soup is well cooked and savoury (you will know from the taste and aroma), add the soaked and deboned catfish, the cooked beef, cowtripe and stockfish.</li>
          <li>Add the remaining chopped peppers. Cover and let it simmer for a bit.</li>
          <li>Add the vegetables and salt if necessary. Cover and once it heats up again, it is done.</li>
          <li>Stir to mix everything very well.</li>
          <li>Transfer to a cool container immediately so the vegetables will remain green and appetizing.</li>
